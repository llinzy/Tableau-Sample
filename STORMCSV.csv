Rainfall amounts during the month of May across the Upper and Middle Red River basins of Southern Oklahoma and Northern Texas totaled over 20 inches of rain. The Oklahoma state climatologist reported that May of 2015 was the all time wettest month of any month in state history. Lake Texhoma, a flood control reservoir to the Red River upstream of Arthur City, Texas rose to its highest pool stage on record early on June 1st at 645.66 feet with peak releases of around 140,000 CFS. The Muddy Boggy Creek tributary to the Red River rose to near its flood of record cresting near 55 feet earlier on May 29th with inflows upwards of 70,000 CFS into the Red River. Muddy Boggy Creek crested just shy of the 1990 flood of record with 55.27 feet near Unger, Oklahoma. Other tributaries of the Red River also crested at very high levels during the final week of May and early in June, 2015 below Lake Texhoma including Bois D'Arc and Bokchito Creeks. Finally the Kiamichi River at Hugo Reservoir crested just below a new pool stage record after May 25th and contributed peak releases of near 60,000 CFS as well to the Red River. This excessive heavy rainfall and inflow into the Red River resulted in river levels that eclipsed the flood of May of 1990 at Pecan Point and was just shy of the Red River flood of May of 1908 at Pecan Point. The Red River at Pecan Point north of Dekalb, Texas went above the 24 foot flood stage on May 10th, 2015 and remained above that flood stage through the entire month of June and did not fall below flood stage until until July, 2015. The Red River at Pecan Point north of Dekalb, Texas went above the 30 foot major flood stage on May 24th, 2015 and crested at a stage of 35.0 feet on June 2nd, 2015. This is the 3rd highest crest in recorded history at the gauging location, eclipsed only by the flood of record of 36.0 feet in 1938 and 35.5 feet in 1908. The river fell below the 30 foot major flood stage on June 10th. A secondary rise on the Red River developed because of excessive heavy rainfall once again in the middle Red River Basin from the remnants of Tropical Storm Bill. As a result, the Red River at Pecan Point north of Dekalb, Texas went back above the 30 foot major flood stage on June 22nd and crested at a stage of 32.5 feet on June 24th. The Red River then fell below the 30 foot major flood stage on June 28th.  Below Pecan Point north of Dekalb, Texas, the Red River at Index, Arkansas crested at 31.4 feet on June 3rd.  This was the 3rd highest flood at Index, Arkansas in recorded history at the gauging location, eclipsed only by the flood of record of 34.4 feet in 1938 and 32.3 feet in 1990. The river fell below the 28 foot major flood stage on June 8th. A secondary rise on the Red River developed because of excessive heavy rainfall once again in the middle Red River Basin from the remnants of Tropical Storm Bill. As a result, the Red River at Index, Arkansas crested again at 26.6 feet on June 27th and fell below the 25 foot flood stage on June 29th. USDA estimated that more than 41,474 acres of pasture land were inundated.

The Oklahoma state climatologist reported that May of 2015 was the all time wettest month of any month in state history.

The river did not crest at Pecan Point north of Dekalb, Texas until the first week of June of 2015 so final crest information will be included in the June, 2015 Storm Data report. The Red River at Pecan Point north of Dekalb, Texas went above the 24 foot flood stage on May 10th, 2015 and remained above that flood stage at the end of the month.

The Oklahoma state climatologist reported that May of 2015 was the all time wettest month of any month in state history.  This excessive heavy rainfall resulted in Red River levels that eclipsed the flood of May of 1990 at Pecan Point and was just shy of the Red River flood of May of 1908 at Pecan Point. The river did not crest at Pecan Point north of Dekalb, Texas until the first week of June of 2015 so final crest information will be included in the June, 2015 Storm Data report.

The Oklahoma state climatologist reported that May of 2015 was the all time wettest month of any month in state history. Lake Texhoma, a flood control reservoir to the Red River upstream of Arthur City, Texas rose to its highest pool stage on record early on June 1st at 645.66 feet with peak releases of around 140,000 CFS. The Muddy Boggy Creek tributary to the Red River rose to near its flood of record cresting near 55 feet earlier on May 29th with inflows upwards of 70,000 CFS into the Red River. Muddy Boggy Creek crested just shy of the 1990 flood of record with 55.27 feet near Unger, Oklahoma. Other tributaries of the Red River also crested at very high levels during the final week of May and early in June, 2015 below Lake Texhoma including Bois D'Arc and Bokchito Creeks. Finally the Kiamichi River at Hugo Reservoir crested just below a new pool stage record after May 25th and contributed peak releases of near 60,000 CFS as well to the Red River. This excessive heavy rainfall and inflow into the Red River resulted river levels that eclipsed the flood of May of 1990 at Pecan Point and was just shy of the Red River flood of May of 1908 at Pecan Point.

This is the 3rd highest crest in recorded history at the gauging location, eclipsed only by the flood of record of 36.0 feet in 1938 and 35.5 feet in 1908. The river fell below the 30 foot major flood stage on June 10th. A secondary rise on the Red River developed because of excessive heavy rainfall once again in the middle Red River Basin from the remnants of Tropical Storm Bill. As a result, the Red River went back above the 30 foot major flood stage on June 22nd and crested at a stage of 32.5 feet on June 24th. The Red River then fell below the 30 foot major flood stage on June 28th. Thousands of acres of pasture and and farm land were flooded and livestock had to be evacuated.

The tornado then moved southeastward over open fields, bounded by Natural Dam Lake to its west and Wilkinson Road just to its east.  The tornado continued on this southeast track along Salt Lake, eventually crossing Interstate 20 at approximately 6:32 pm CDT.  ||South of Interstate 20, the tornado exhibited erratic movement, being described by chasers and spotters as being nearly stationary in a field.  Examination of radar imagery showed the primary storm circulation moved slowly southeastward to approximately half a mile northwest of the intersection of Lintner Road and Rockhouse Road by 6:37 pm CDT, before turning eastward.  The tornado continued to move east, with the southern periphery of the tornado affecting Home #1.  The tornado then began to move northeastward, crossing nearly directly over Home #2 around 6:40 pm CDT.  A slight east northeast turn allowed for only the tornado's northern periphery to affect Home #3 along Cauble Road around 6:42 pm CDT.||The tornado moved southward along or near Cauble Road.  The tornado continued its erratic behavior, moving southwestward and re-entering the same field as previous around 6:48 pm CDT.  The tornado then turned west-northwestward, eventually becoming quasi-stationary just east of the Home #1 between 6:52 pm and 6:54 pm CDT, before moving westward, just north of Home #1.  Residents at home #1 described how long the tornado lasted and felt the tornado had impacted them twice. The tornado dissipated approximately 1.5 miles west of Home #1 around 7 pm CDT.||The damage assessment team looked at several different indicators to determine tornado intensity.  At Home #2, which likely was the closest and strongest structure to the tornado during the most intense portion of the tornado's life cycle, the entire roof was destroyed and exterior walls on this well-constructed residence were partially collapsed.  This damage indicator suggests an EF-3 intensity with wind speeds estimated at 140-160 mph.  In the adjacent field east of Home #2, a 640 type pump jack was blown over.  The assessment team also looked at tree damage at Home #2.  Both softwood and hardwood trees were viewed on the property.  Damage to these large trees was indicative of high end EF-2 to low end EF-3 damage.||Home #1 and Home #3 experienced tornado damage indicative of EF-2 damage.  In the examples shown, large sections of the roof were removed, but with the walls still standing.  At Home #3, there were power poles that were snapped approximately five feet off the ground.  Wind speeds at this residence are estimated at 115 to 125 mph.  At Home #1, trees were uprooted.  Wind speeds are estimated at this location of 105 to 115 mph.

This type of occurrence is associated with wind speeds in the 140-160 mph range.  Thus, the tornado has been rated as briefly reaching EF-3 intensity.  Broken tree limbs were observed by the assessment team two miles north of Garden City, just west of Ranch Road 33.  This damage indicator suggested the tornado had weakened to EF-1 intensity at that point.  This weakening trend coincided with the tornado taking a more southeast track as it crossed Ranch Road 33.  The tornado dissipated at 8:54 pm CDT, two miles north of Garden City.  In total, the tornado traveled a 3.7 mile path and had an estimated width of 200 yards.
